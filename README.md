## 🧪 Technical Details

### Brick Optimization Algorithm

The application uses an intelligent **greedy algorithm** to optimize brick placement:

#### Supported Brick Sizes

- **Large bricks**: 2×8, 2×6, 2×4 plates
- **Medium bricks**: 2×3, 2×2, 1×4, 1×3 plates
- **Small bricks**: 1×2, 1×1 plates/tiles

#### Algorithm Workflow

1. **Scan** the QR grid from top-left to bottom-right
2. **Try largest bricks first** at each position
3. **Test both orientations** (horizontal and vertical)
4. **Place brick** if all cells match color and are unused
5. **Mark cells as used** and continue
6. **Fallback to smaller bricks** if large ones don't fit

#### Performance

- **Time Complexity**: O(n × m × k) where:
  - n = grid height
  - m = grid width
  - k = number of brick types (9)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n × m) for tracking used cells
- **Typical Savings**: 40-60% reduction in pieces

#### Example Results

For a 37×37 QR code (1,369 studs):

- **Before**: 1,369 pieces (all 1×1)
- **After**: 643 pieces (optimized)
- **Breakdown**: 28× 2×4, 24× 1×4, 104× 2×2, 75× 1×2, 62× 1×1
- **Savings**: 53% (726 fewer pieces)

### QR Code Types & Payload Formats

| Type     | Payload format example                          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| WiFi     | `WIFI:T:WPA;S:mynetwork;P:mypassword;H:false;;` |
| URL      | `https://example.com`                           |
| Text     | `Hello, world!`                                 |
| Email    | `mailto:user@example.com?subject=Hi&body=Hello` |
| Phone    | `tel:+15550001234`                              |
| SMS      | `smsto:+15550001234:My message`                 |
| Location | `geo:48.8584,2.2945?q=Eiffel%20Tower`           |

### Error Correction

The application uses Level H (High) error correction, which allows for:

- Up to 30% of the QR code to be damaged/obscured
- Best for physical builds where some bricks might be misaligned

### Contrast Calculation

Uses the WCAG 2.1 contrast ratio formula:

- **Excellent**: 7:1 or higher (WCAG AAA)
- **Good**: 4.5:1 or higher (WCAG AA)
- **Poor**: Below 4.5:1 (may be difficult to scan)

### Scaling

- 1× scale: Each QR pixel = 1×1 stud
- 2× scale: Each QR pixel = 2×2 studs
- 3× scale: Each QR pixel = 3×3 studs
- 4× scale: Each QR pixel = 4×4 studs

Larger scales are easier to build but require more bricks.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- QR code generation powered by [qrcode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode)
- Built with [Nuxt.js 3](https://nuxt.com/)
- WCAG contrast guidelines from [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/)

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Color Selection**: Use high-contrast colors for reliable scanning
   - Black on white is always a safe choice
   - Avoid light-on-light or dark-on-dark combinations

2. **Baseplate Size**: Larger baseplates allow for bigger QR codes
   - Start with 32×32 for most networks
   - Use 48×48 for complex passwords or higher scales

3. **Building Tips**:
   - Use 1×1 tiles for a smooth finish
   - Use 1×1 plates if tiles aren't available
   - Build on a flat baseplate for best results
   - Double-check alignment before scanning

4. **Testing**: Always test your QR code with multiple devices before committing to a large build!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### QR Code Won't Scan

- Check contrast ratio (should be "Good" or "Excellent")
- Ensure all bricks are properly aligned
- Try increasing the scale factor
- Test in good lighting conditions
- Make sure camera is perpendicular to the build

### Build Doesn't Fit Baseplate

- Choose a larger baseplate
- Reduce the scale factor
- Use a shorter SSID or password if possible
